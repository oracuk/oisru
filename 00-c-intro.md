# Introduction

A Risk Universe provides a comprehensive view of the possible risks we face. This view is designed to aid in categorisation but also to act as a check on the scope of our risk identification exercises to ensure we donâ€™t miss risks that then take us by surprise when they occur.

The goal of the Open Information Security Risk Universe (OISRU) is to provide a model and method independent framework and taxonomy for expressing and categorising security risk.

This framework should be complementary to the Basel II operational risk event types, recognising that information security risk permeates operational risk.

## Overview of the Risk Universe

The Open Information Security Risk Universe comprises, at it's core, Sources of Risk Events, Risk Events and Consequences of Risk Events. These are supplemented by Risk Factors that drive the Frequency or Severity of the Risks.

The Open Information Security Risk Universe does not directly address likelihood, consequence or controls as these are covered in other relevant analysis and evaluation methods.

## Definitions

**Risk**: *The effect of uncertainty on objectives. Usually expressed in terms of risk sources, possible events and their consequences and likelihood.* (Source: ISO 31000)

**Sources of Risk**: *Element which alone or in combination has the potential to give rise  to risk.* (Source: ISO 31000)

**Risk Event**:  *Occurence or a change of a particular set of circumstances.* (Source: ISO 31000)

**Consequences**: *Outcome of an event affecting objectives.* (Source: ISO 31000)

**Likelihood**: *Chance of something occuring*. (Source: ISO 31000)

**Control**: *Measure that maintains or modifies risk*. (Source: ISO 31000)

**Basel II Operational Risk Event Types**: Basel II defines a detailed loss event type classification with 7 Level 1 operational risk event types (Source: Basel II: International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A Revised Framework - Comprehensive Version):

 - **Internal Fraud**: *Losses due to acts of a type intended to defraud, misappropriate property or circumvent regulations, the law or company policy, excluding diversity discrimination events, which involves at least one internal party*

 - **External Fraud**: *Losses due to acts of a type intended to defraud, misappropriate property or circumvent the law, by a third party*

 - **Employment Practices and Workplace Safety**: *Losses arising from acts inconsistent with employment, health or safety laws or agreements, from payment of personal injury claims, or from diversity / discrimination events*

 - **Clients, Products & Business, Practices**: *Losses arising from an unintentional or negligent failure to meet a professional obligation to specific clients (including fiduciary and suitability requirements), or from the nature or design of a product.*

 - **Damage to Physical Assets**: *Losses arising from loss or damage to physical assets from natural disaster or other events.*

 - **Business Disruption and System Failures**: *Losses arising from disruption of business or system failures.*

 - **Execution, Delivery & Process Management**: *Losses from failed transaction processing or process management, from relations with trade counterparties and vendors.*

## Other Relevant Standards

* NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-30 R1 Guide for conducting risk assessments* has a comprehensive set of threat sources (Risk Sources) in Appendix D, a *very* comprehensive set of threat events (Risk Events) in Appendix E and a list of effects of threat events (Consequences) in Appendix H.

* NIST SP 800-37 R2 Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations has a 3-level approach to managing risk at the organisational level, the mission/business process level, and the information system level. 

* NIST Interagency/Internal Report (IR) 8286A Identifying and Estimating Cybersecurity Risk for Enterprise Risk Management has as a examples of risk categories in Section 2.2.6 (Risk Categorisation):
  * Risk framework groupings, such as by security and privacy control families (e.g., Access Control, Supply Chain Risk Management, such as those recorded in NIST SP 800-53)
 
  * Threat types, such as intentional disclosures, unintended modifications, system failures, or natural disasters. 
 
  * Impact considerations based on business units affected or information systems impacted. 

* Octave Allegro has an indicative set of threat trees in Step 5 (Risk Sources) and in Appendix B includes the Impact Areas (Consequences) and in Appendix C includes Threat Scenarios (Risk Events).

All the standards mentioned above, are very useful and highly recommended sources but they do tie their taxonomy into specific qualitative methods for risk analysis. The goal of OSIRU is to be independent of any particular analysis model, whether quantitative or qualitative.

* ISO27005 includes a list of consequences in Appendix B.2.3 and Appendix C includes a mixed list of events and sources. Appendix C seems to use the term consequences in a somewhat muddled way.
